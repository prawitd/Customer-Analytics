Calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the hotel booking business is essential for understanding the long-term value that each customer brings to your business. CLV helps you make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, customer retention efforts, and overall business growth. The formula for calculating CLV can be adapted for a hotel booking business as follows:

```
CLV = (Average Purchase Value * Average Purchase Frequency * Average Customer Lifespan)
```

Average Purchase Value: This represents the average amount a customer spends on hotel bookings during each stay. To calculate this, you can sum up the total revenue from hotel bookings and divide it by the total number of bookings over a specific period.

```
SELECT SUM(TotalAmount) / COUNT(DISTINCT BookingID) AS AveragePurchaseValue
FROM HotelBookings;
```

Average Purchase Frequency: This indicates how often, on average, a customer makes a booking. It can be calculated by dividing the total number of bookings by the number of unique customers.

```
SELECT COUNT(BookingID) / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS AveragePurchaseFrequency
FROM HotelBookings;
```

Average Customer Lifespan: This represents the average number of years a customer continues to book hotels with your business. You can estimate this based on historical data or customer retention rates.
Once you have these three components, you can calculate the CLV by multiplying them:

```
SELECT
   (SELECT SUM(TotalAmount) / COUNT(DISTINCT BookingID) FROM HotelBookings) AS AveragePurchaseValue,
   (SELECT COUNT(BookingID) / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) FROM HotelBookings) AS AveragePurchaseFrequency,
   #You can estimate Average Customer Lifespan based on historical data. For example, if the average customer stays with your hotel for 3 years:
   3 AS AverageCustomerLifespan,
   ((SELECT SUM(TotalAmount) / COUNT(DISTINCT BookingID) FROM HotelBookings) *
   (SELECT COUNT(BookingID) / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) FROM HotelBookings) *
   3) AS CustomerLifetimeValue;
```

Customer lifetime value (CLV) can be used to adopt;

Loyalty Programs: Implementing loyalty programs that reward customers for their continued patronage is a common CLV strategy. Customers with high CLVs can earn points or receive exclusive perks for their loyalty.

Customer Retention: Understanding CLV helps hotels focus on retaining high-value customers. Special attention can be given to keeping these customers satisfied and engaged.
