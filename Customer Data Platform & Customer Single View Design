Here is an overview of a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for e-commerce businesses based on collecting online usage data with GA4. It consists of Data Source, Data Standardize, Data Synthesize, Activation, and Destination.

Data Source
The first step is to collect data from a variety of sources, such as website visits, app usage, email interactions, and social media activity. GA4 can collect data from all of these sources, and it can also be used to collect data from third-party sources, such as CRM systems and marketing platforms.

Data Standardize
Once the data is collected, it needs to be standardized so that it can be easily understood and analyzed. This involves converting the data into a common format, and it also involves removing any duplicate or inaccurate data.

Data Synthesize
Once the data is standardized, it can be synthesized to create a single view of the customer. This involves combining data from different sources, and it also involves identifying relationships between different data points.

Activation
The activated data can then be used to create personalized marketing campaigns, improve customer service, and make better business decisions. This involves using the data to create targeted messages and experiences, and it also involves using the data to identify trends and patterns.

Destination
The activated data can be stored in a variety of destinations, such as a CRM system, a marketing platform, or a data warehouse. This allows the data to be easily accessed by different departments within the business.
