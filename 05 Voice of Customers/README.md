In the case of a restaurant with both good and bad reviews, topic modeling could be used to identify the most common topics in the reviews, as well as the relationships between different topics. This could help the restaurant to understand what customers are saying about their food, service, and atmosphere. Word cloud could also be used to visualize the frequency of words in the reviews, which could help the restaurant to identify the most common words that are used to describe their restaurant.
