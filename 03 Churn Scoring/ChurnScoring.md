#sample SQL query for churn scoring

SELECT
  customer_id,
  churn,
  AVG(churn_probability) AS churn_score
FROM
  churn_prediction_model
GROUP BY
  customer_id

#This query will calculate the churn probability for each customer and then average the churn probabilities for each customer. This will give each customer a churn score, which can be used to identify customers who are at risk of churning.
#The churn probability can be calculated using a variety of machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The best model for a particular situation will depend on the data set and the specific business goals.

#sample Python code for churn scoring

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load the data set
data = pd.read_csv("churn_data.csv")

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, data["Churn"], test_size=0.2)

# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the churn probabilities for the test data
y_pred = model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Calculate the churn score for each customer
churn_score = y_pred[:, 1]

# Print the churn score for the first 5 customers
print(churn_score[:5])

#This code will load the data set, split it into train and test sets, create a logistic regression model, fit the model to the training data, predict the churn probabilities for the test data, and calculate the churn score for each customer.

#The churn score is a continuous value between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means that the customer is not likely to churn, while a score of 1 means that the customer is very likely to churn.

#Here is a sample of the results:

[0.07692308 0.23076923 0.15384615 0.92307692 0.07692308]

#In this case, the first customer has a churn score of 0.0769, which means that they are not likely to churn. The second customer has a churn score of 0.2307, which means that they are somewhat likely to churn. The third customer has a churn score of 0.1538, which means that they are somewhat unlikely to churn. The fourth customer has a churn score of 0.9230, which means that they are very likely to churn. The fifth customer has a churn score of 0.0769, which means that they are not likely to churn.

#The churn score can be used to identify customers who are at risk of churning and take steps to prevent them from leaving.
